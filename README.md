## ClipTranslator

Translates video clips of human speech from source language to target language, and adds lip-syncingfor a realistic video-audio match

Uses 11labs for voice dubbing, video-retalking for lipsyncing and modal labs for deployment.

The demos below use Wav2Lip. This project was retired soon after porting lipsyncing to the updated video-retalking model, which is why Wav2Lip has been removed from the source code.
